# Description

This is a simple demo to show how to make sure that the LoginUrlAuthenticationEntryPoint's port mapper is overridden to map ports:

- `80` to `80`
- `8080` to `8080`

when redirecting to `https`. This basically addresses the annoying issue:

[OAuth2 client: default redirection to login page is done on wrong socket when SSL is enabled (authorization-server instead of client)](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/issues/12307)
